# T2 Fix observations

In attempt to create a more streamlined experience for future installs of Thief 2, as well as potentially for those who are after a more flexible install of Thief, I elected to explore the possibilities of creating a soft-modded file structure, whereby modifications are not made to the original files, instead simply 'injected' into the game.

It should be noted *that I know absolutely nothing about any of the programming behind this*. This is coming from a place where I believe the Thief series deserves *better* than the work of just one person - Voodoo - who has been known to introduce questionable changes to his 'fix pack' on multiple occassions. This is not to mention that his, ahem, professional attitude to the development of his Thief patches is lacking.

So, here are some observations on Thief 2 Fix, as it currently stands.

### T2Fix Installer - Required files

The purpose of this section is to highlight what files the T2Fix full installer requires to be in a directory for it to be considered a 'Thief 2' install directory.
The installer does check for a fair few files, though I'm not sure what the purpose of these dependencies are - this is where having the source to these installers publically avaliable would be most beneficial and is, indeed, part of the reason for this investigation.

So far, I have determined that the installer checks for these specific files:

- MOVIES folder
  - All named files within (e.g. B01.avi)
- RES folder
  - All named files within (e.g. bitmap.crf)
- Dark.gam
- gen.osm
- MISS8.MIS
- Thief2.exe

The installer *does not* check beyond the name of the file.
