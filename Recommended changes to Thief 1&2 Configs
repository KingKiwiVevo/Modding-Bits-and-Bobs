; force game to run in windowed mode

; enable software (ie. shader) based gamma and color processing (improves quality at the expense of performance,
; and also enables in-game gamma to be applied in windowed mode)
d3d_disp_sw_cc (enable this for gamma and colour corrections in windowed mode)

; use high resolution timers (preferable but disabled by default for best compatibility, as it may not work
; correctly on older OS versions, such as some XP systems where hi-res timer implementation uses RDTSC, which can
; result in movement speeds going crazy and more)
use_hi_res_timer

; enable new mantling code
new_mantle (ESSENTIAL)

; scale bitmap based inventory icons/objects at higher screen resolutions (like body carry icon)
scaled_inv_bitmaps

; open last viewed map page if no automap location is found for current player location
dark_map_remember_last

; left align map notes
dark_map_lalign_notes
